### New Data Model

A new data model (TimeSeries.java, TimeSeriesInstance.java and TimeSeriesInstances.java) has been created in the TSML toolkit - it allows time series data to have missing attributes and allows predictions on more than one attribute. Focus was aimed at making the new data model as easy as possible to parse time series data in, this is done by allowing time series data to be in the form of a double array, a list of doubles, and time series objects; and when the hash code is compared, they are all equal i.e. the double array hash code would be equal to the double list hash code etc. This means that caching of time series can be used to reduce the computational power needed if some processing on the time series has already been done and stored. Resampling the data has also been a high focus too as it gives more accurate results, by taking the train and test time series data, mixing them together and then splitting into separate train and test files again to run multiple passes on. This and many other tasks such as finding the standard deviation, have been made very simple with the inclusion of a many helper functions for the new data model.
